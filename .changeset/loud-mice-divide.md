feat(console): Support assigning API resource permissions to organization roles

## Updates

- Separated the "Organization template" from the "Organization" page, establishing it as a standalone page for clearer navigation and functionality.
- Enhanced the "Organization template" page by adding functionality that allows users to click on an organization role, which then navigates to the organization role details page where users can view its corresponding permissions and general settings.
- Enabled the assignment of API resource permissions directly from the organization role details page, improving role management and access control.
